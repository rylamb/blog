Challenge Creator: Xh4H

**Challenge Description:**&quot;Show us your basic skills! (P.S. There are 4 ways to solve this, are you willing to try them all?)&quot;

Download and unzip the archive to retrieve the file. Analyzing with the `file` command show that this is a Linux executable.

If we make the file executable with `chmod +x` and run it, it asks for a key to be inserted. Simply hitting enter gives us the message &quot;Try again later.&quot;

## **The Easy Way**

Running `hexdump -C` shows the readable contents of the file.

Within the contents of the file is what appears to be a flag that is not quite properly formatted, a note saying, &quot;Don&#39;t run `strings` on this challenge, that is not the way!!!!&quot;. There are also the messages &quot;Insert key&quot; and &quot;Try again later&quot; with the value &quot;abcde122313&quot; nested between. We can try entering that as the key. Naturally we could have found the same information using `strings`.

## **The Harder Way**

We can take a closer look at how the flag is being created by using radare2, analyzing the file with `aaa`, then disassembling main.

The important pieces here are the variables on the stack…

…and what looks to be flag construction and output.

The break down of the code is as follows:

1. (0x11a3) The value [REDACTED] is loaded into the register RAX.
2. (0x11ad) Radare2 doesn&#39;t give a nice print out here, but if we split the values into hexadecimal bytes, reverse the order to account for little-endianness of x86 systems, and translate to an ASCII character, we can see that this line is storing the value [REDACTED] into the register RDX.
3. (0x11b7) [REDACTED], stored in RAX, is moved into the character pointer at the address referenced by RBP-0x40.
4. (0x11bb) [REDACTED], stored in RDX, is moved into var\_38h located at RBP-0x38.
5. (0x11bf) [REDACTED] is moved into var\_30h at the address of rbp-0x30.
6. (0x11c6) [REDACTED] is moved into var\_2ch at the address of rbp-0x2c.
7. (0x11cc – 0x11d0) Registers are loaded with our values in preparation for a system call.
8. (0x11d3) Puts() is called to print the value of our string located in the range of rbp-0x40 through rbp-0x20.

To simplify, this code simply constructs the string [REDACTED] and prints it to stdout. With this information we can bypass entering the key altogether!

## **Solution**

The full writeup is locked with the flag. [See the full writeup][writeup_url]
